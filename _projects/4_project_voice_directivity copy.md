Knowing how sound radiates from the human voice is essential in many applications, including telecommunications, virtual reality, and room acoustic design. At low frequencies, voice radiation is omnidirectional. As frequency increases, the primary axis of radiation evolves from below the mouth to above the head. At higher frequencies, the radiation is primarily oriented forward.
