Regular polyhedral loudspeakers (RPLs) are specialized loudspeakers used in room acoustics applications. They typically employ several drivers spaced at the vertices or faces of regular polyedra such as dodecahedrons, icosahedrons, or octahedrons.

The motivating design concept is that by distributing several loudspeaker drivers in different directions, the loudspeaker will become more omnidirectional.

However, the frequency at which the RPL deviates from omnidirectionality depends on the loudspeaker radius and driver size. My current research studies how one can optimize these parameters to increase the range of omnidirectionality of RPLs.
