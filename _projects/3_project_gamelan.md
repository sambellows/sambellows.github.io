Gongs are an important part of the Gamelan, a traditional Indonesian percussion orchestra. Previous work at the <a href="https://acoustics.byu.edu/overview">Acoustics Research Group </a> studied how non-linear vibration contribute to a beated phenomena referred to as ombak. Our more recent research efforts on the acoustics of these gongs have considered their sound radiation.
