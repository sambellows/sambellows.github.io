Geometric acoustics simulations are used across areas of architectural acoustics for improved sound design. Nonetheless, an important aspect of creating a numerical model is selecting material properties so that measured data agrees with the simulation input. One area of my research is to generate numerical methods to calibrate geometric acoustics models.
