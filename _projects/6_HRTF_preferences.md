Head related transfer functions (HRTFs) are commonly used in virtual reality and spatial audio applications. HRTF individualization is an important aspect to ensure that listeners have an immersive experience. Currently, we are working on a study to analyze HRTF preferences among a fixed subset of HRTFs available in the <a href="http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen/">LISTEN HRTF database</a>.
