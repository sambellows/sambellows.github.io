I am currently a Ph.D. candidate working in the <a href="https://acoustics.byu.edu/overview" target="_blank">Acoustics Research Group</a> at Brigham Young University's 
department of Physics and Astronomy. My primary area of research entails studying sound radiation from musical instruments through directivity measurements. Our research group is currently 
collecting data to generate a directivity database for use in improving concert hall acoustics, microphone placement, and sound synthesis of musical 
instruments. Outside of musical acoustics, I enjoy studying about and applying techniques in array signal processing, applied mathematics, and numerical 
methods. My research advisor is <a href="https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/leishman"  target="_blank">Dr. Timothy Leishman.</a>
