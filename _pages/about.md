I am currently an assistant professor at the University of Utah Asia Campus in Songdo, South Korea. 

Before my current position, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/lam/" target="_blank">Lutheries-Acoustique-Musique group</a> at the Institut Jean le Rond d'Alembert at the Sorbonne University in Paris, France. I completed my PhD working in the <a href="https://acoustics.byu.edu/overview" target="_blank">Acoustics Research Group</a> at Brigham Young University's 
department of Physics and Astronomy, under <a href="https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/leishman" target="_blank">Dr. Timothy Leishman</a>. My primary area of research entails studying sound radiation from musical instruments through directivity measurements. Our research group is collecting data to generate a <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/directivity/" target="_blank"> directivity database </a> for use in improving concert hall acoustics, microphone placement, and sound synthesis of musical instruments. Outside of musical acoustics, I enjoy studying about and applying techniques in array signal processing, applied mathematics, and numerical methods.
